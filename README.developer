0) CODING STYLE
4 space wide soft tabs
don't go over 80 chars wide on a line
never cut and paste more than 2 lines of code.  use a function.
good use of whitespace
good comments.  don't comment obvious stuff, explain complicated stuff

1) AUTOGEN
./autogen.sh is not your friend.  Very strict requirements.  Makefile.tools
is your friend.  Do 'make -f Makefile.tools' to install all the necessary
build tools into ./buildtools/bin.  Then prepend that to your PATH and
then ./autogen.sh will just work.

2) CONFIGURE
./easyconf.sh is your friend.  Here are the environment variables I set:

setenv PLFS_WANT_ALL_DEBUG 1
setenv PLFS_WANT_DEBUG_FLAGS 1
setenv PLFS_WANT_VERBOSE_CONF_OUT 1 
setenv PLFS_WANT_ADIO 0
# treat all build warnings as errors.  No build warnings!
setenv CFLAGS '-Wall -Werror'
setenv CXXFLAGS '-Wall -Werror'

Notice especially the bottom two.  We want warning free code so print out
all warnings and treat them as errors.

3) DEBUGGING WITH MLOG
Please read README.mlog
