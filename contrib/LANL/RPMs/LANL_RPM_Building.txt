Building the LANL PLFS RPMs is fairly easy.  Use the spec and source 
files for the version you want to create. You will also need to have
the sys_typ.sh script in your path or in the directory from where 
you issue the rpmbuild command.

From wherever you build, just do the following:

$ rpmbuild -bb ./SPECS/plfs-2.1-lanl.spec

That will create the plfs and plfs-lib RPMs in the ./RPMS/ subdir.
