We need to write a test suite but in the meantime, 
here is the list of functionality tests that should 
be performed before committing.  We also should add
some performance testing.

1) Run 'make test' in the fuse dir.

2) Create a file and make sure all the files in
the container have the appropriate permissions.

3) Chgrp the file and make sure all the files in
the container have the appropriate permissions.

4) cd into the mountpoint, co the plfs src,
make the SC paper into a pdf, open the pdf

5) run fs_test with N-1 strided and touch -2 and
check -2 with at least 2 procs

6) run the qio tests
