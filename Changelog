~~~ Version 0.1.5

1) Changed the behavior of truncate to not remove droppings but just to truncate
them.  This was needed because we discovered that if one proc already has open
handles to droppings, another can do a truncate, and then those droppings 
disappear when the handles are closed.  This was discovered using the qio
tests which don't do barriers after open and closes.

2) Fixed reference counting bugs in the Plfs_fd structure.  Again this was 
discovered due to the lack of barriers in the qio tests.  When we had 
simultaneous readers and writers in a Plfs_fd structure, some of the closes
were screwing up the reference counting, and other thread's Plfs_fd structures
were being removed out from under them.
