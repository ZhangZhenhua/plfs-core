1) doing a cvs co often fails with:
cvs [checkout aborted]: cannot rename file CVS/Entries.Backup to CVS/Entries:
Function not implemented This is because PLFS currently cowardly refuses to
rename an open file.  CVS only sometimes runs into this problem; when it
happens you can just cvs co over and over again until finally it works.
RESOLVED:  I think I fixed this.  I put some code in rename to rename open
files, and I wrote a test, and I tried the cvs stuff and it hasn't broke!  It
did break again and I fixed it again.  Check the ChangeLog of 0.1.5.

2) cd /users/johnbent/Testing/openmpi-1.3.3/ompi/mca/io/romio/romio/test
   mpirun -np 1 ./large_file -fname /tmp/bar
   mpirun -np 1 ./large_file -fname plfs:/tmp/bar
This fails because there is a file in the place where PLFS wants to make
a container.  RESOLVED: when this error is seen, unlink the file, and try
again.

3) bad reference counting in the Plfs_fd structure.  See the ChangeLog for 
0.1.5

4) truncate in the Container was removing other thread's open file handles.
See the ChangeLog of 0.1.5
