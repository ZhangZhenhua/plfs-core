OPEN:

1) doing a cvs co often fails with:
cvs [checkout aborted]: cannot rename file CVS/Entries.Backup to CVS/Entries: Function not implemented
This is because PLFS currently cowardly refuses to rename an open file.  CVS
only sometimes runs into this problem; when it happens you can just cvs co
over and over again until finally it works.  

CLOSED:
2) cd /users/johnbent/Testing/openmpi-1.3.3/ompi/mca/io/romio/romio/test
   mpirun -np 1 ./large_file -fname /tmp/bar
   mpirun -np 1 ./large_file -fname plfs:/tmp/bar
This fails because there is a file in the place where PLFS wants to make
a container.  RESOLVED: when this error is seen, unlink the file, and try
again.
